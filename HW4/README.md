The DCGAN, WGAN and ACGAN models along with training code are in the files dcgan.ipynb, wgan.ipynb and acgan.ipynb respectively.

The FID.ipynb file contains the code to calculate the FID score, which is used in the trainig file of each of the 3 GAN models.

The compare_performance.ipynb loads the 3 saved numpy arrays of FID scores for each of the 3 models and then compares them by plotting on the same axes.
